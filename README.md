## Installation

### Installing Hugo

If you have not already installed Hugo on your machine please follow the official [installation guide](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/) - Once Hugo is installed you may continue with the steps below.

### Create a new Hugo Site

Create a new Hugo site

```
hugo new site mynewsite
```

This will create a new Hugo site in the folder `mynewsite`. Next you need to install this theme in the sites themes folder `mynewsites/themes` 

You may do this by git cloning this repo into the `themes` folder. 

```
cd mynewsite
cd themes
git clone https://github.com/jugglerx/hugo-hero-theme.git
```

Alternatively you may download the .zip file located here https://github.com/JugglerX/hugo-hero-theme/archive/master.zip. Extract the .zip inside the `themes` folder. Rename the theme from `hugo-hero-theme-master` -> `hugo-hero-theme`. You should end up with the following folder structure `mynewsites/themes/hugo-hero-theme`

### Adding the example content

The fastest way to get started is to copy the example content. Copy the contents of the `exampleSite` folder to the root folder of your Hugo site. This theme comes with content for the following content types: `services` and `work`. The `about` us page is a single page with alternating fullwidth sections. It includes JSON data for `features` and `contact`. It also includes the `config.toml` file which has an example menu.

### Configuring the theme

After you copy the `config.toml` into the root folder of your Hugo site you will need to update the `baseURL`, `themesDir` and `theme` values in the `config.toml`

```
baseURL = "/"
themesDir = "themes" // you can also remove this line
theme = "hugo-hero-theme" // or whatever you rename the theme folder too
```

### Running Hugo

After installing the theme, generate the Hugo site.

```
hugo
```

Hugo's built-in local server.

```
hugo server
```

Now enter [`localhost:1313`](http://localhost:1313) in the address bar of your browser.

## Running Hugo From within exampleSite

If you have just cloned/downloaded the theme and have not placed it inside an existing Hugo site you can still run the theme against the `exampleSite` locally using the following command. 

```
hugo server --source exampleSite --config exampleSite/config.toml --themesDir ../.. --theme hugo-hero-theme
```

This is a less standard approach but may be convenient for some, particularly those who wish to maintain a single theme repo and also deploy a live demo to Netlify.

See this discussion on how to deploy your site on Netlify from the `exampleSite` folder - https://discourse.gohugo.io/t/deploy-your-theme-to-netlify/15508
